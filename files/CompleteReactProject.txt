This task involves completing a React project assignment, which includes creating a fully functional to-do list application. The project must include features such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks, marking tasks as completed, and filtering tasks by status (all, completed, or pending). 

The app should be built using React, with state management handled by React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. Additionally, use React Router for routing between pages and implement proper form validation for adding new tasks. The project should be styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.

Ensure the code is well-documented and follows best practices for React development. A detailed README should be included to explain how to run the application and the technologies used.
